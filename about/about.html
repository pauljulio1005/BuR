        <h1>Warranty Policy</h1>
        <p>At Buy and Repair.net, we are committed to providing you with high-quality products and exceptional service, 
          and we offer a comprehensive warranty policy to ensure your peace of mind with every purchase and repair. <br>
          All products purchased from us come with a standard 1-year warranty, though specific items may have different durations. <br>
          This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. If a product malfunctions or fails due to a manufacturing defect within the warranty period, <br>
          we will repair, replace, or refund the item based on our assessment. <br>
          However, the warranty does not cover damage caused by misuse, accidents, unauthorized repairs, wear and tear,<br>
           or environmental factors such as liquid exposure or extreme temperatures. <br>
          If you need to file a warranty claim, simply contact our customer service team with proof of purchase, and we will guide you through the process.<br>
          <br>
          For repairs, we offer a 90-day warranty on all services provided. This covers the quality of our workmanship and any parts replaced during the repair. <br>
          If the same issue arises or the replacement part fails within 90 days, we will repair the device free of charge. <br>
          However, the warranty does not cover damage resulting from misuse, accidents, or issues unrelated to the original repair.<br>
         To claim a repair warranty, please reach out to our customer service team, and we will arrange for the necessary assessment and, if eligible, provide free repair services.<br>
         <br>
          There are certain exclusions to our warranty coverage, including consumables like batteries, chargers, <br>
          screen protectors, and accessories unless they are defective upon arrival.<br>
           The warranty is valid only for the original purchaser and is not transferable. <br>
           Additionally, our warranty applies solely to products and repairs performed at Buy and Repair.net,<br>
            so please contact us for guidance if you require warranty service outside of the country of purchase.<br>
           <br>
          To initiate a warranty claim for either a product or repair, please contact our support team with proof of purchase and a description of the issue.<br>
         If necessary, we may request that you return the product or repaired device for inspection. <br>
         Our team will then assess the issue and determine whether it qualifies for warranty service. <br>
         If approved, we will proceed with a repair, replacement, or refund. At Buy and Repair.net, <br>
         we strive to offer transparency and exceptional service, and we are dedicated to ensuring your satisfaction with our products and services.<br>
          Feel free to contact us with any questions regarding our warranty policy or to initiate a claim.</p>
